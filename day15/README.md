I had a lot of problems with day 15 part 2.  It was easy enough to follow
implementations of A* for part 1, but I had to refer to hints and other
implementations for part 2, mainly because I:

* haven't worked with priority queues in years
* had a bug in my generation of the 5x5 tile

ALWAYS check your input first!

I do not consider this implementation very good at all; I'm still learning
Go.

A very large thanks to @lizthegrey for help, whose implemntation is very
elegant.
